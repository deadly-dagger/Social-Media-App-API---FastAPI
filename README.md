Documentation of API: https://fastapi-dagger.herokuapp.com/docs 

API Deployment: https://fastapi-dagger.herokuapp.com

This Repository contains the code for an API that provides general functionalities for a Social Media App 
    - to Create Users, to Authenticate User Login, to Create, View, Update and Delete Posts.
    
All operations are authenticated according to their functionalities. This project was done out of an interest based on a youtube course. I had my Web Development Course 
this semester in my University where I learnt to develop basic full stack web applications - the backend was implemented using php and MySQL. Being curious about APIs and Python, I learnt how to develop
APIs in Python from a freecodecamp course on how to develop Python APIs. This project was the outcome of my learnings.
